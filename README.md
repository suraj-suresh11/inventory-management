# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization using Python
In this repository, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to perform demand forecasting and inventory optimization using Python. Demand forecasting involves predicting customer orders' quantity and pattern, crucial for resource allocation, inventory management, and production planning. Inventory optimization aims to balance stock levels to meet demand while minimizing costs and maximizing customer satisfaction.

### Introduction
Demand forecasting and inventory optimization are essential processes for businesses, especially in retail, manufacturing, and distribution industries. Accurate forecasting helps in efficient resource allocation, while optimization ensures that the right amount of inventory is available at the right time.

### Process Overview
1. Data Collection: Gather historical sales data, customer orders, and relevant external factors like seasonality and economic trends.
2. Demand Forecasting: Use appropriate forecasting models like SARIMA or exponential smoothing to predict future demand based on historical data.
3. Inventory Optimization: Optimize inventory levels using strategies like reorder points, safety stock, and economic order quantity (EOQ) calculations based on the forecasted demand.

### Getting Started
#### Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy plotly statsmodels matplotlib

### Data
We provide a sample dataset (demand_inventory.csv) containing historical demand and inventory data. You can use your own dataset for analysis.

### Contents
demand_forecasting.py: Python script for demand forecasting using SARIMA model.
inventory_optimization.py: Python script for inventory optimization based on forecasted demand.
demand_inventory.csv: Sample dataset for demand forecasting and inventory optimization.

### Results
After running the scripts, you will obtain:
Demand forecast for the next period.
Optimal order quantity, reorder point, safety stock, and total cost for inventory optimization.

### Conclusion
Demand forecasting and inventory optimization are vital processes for businesses to ensure efficient operations and customer satisfaction. By leveraging Python and appropriate forecasting models, businesses can make informed decisions to manage their inventory effectively.
